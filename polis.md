# Housing

In the United States, house prices continue to rise during high interest rates.  The government backed mortgage lenders Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac lend home loans out under 30 year fixed-term rates.  Borrowers that entered mortgage agreements at the interest rate nadir will enjoy a lower repayment rate than their contemporaries attempting to purchase a house.  New entrant buyers who want to purchase a home but are unable to meet the increasing mortgage interest rate will be excluded from the housing market, leading to a decrease in demand for housing.  Homeowners are disincentivised from selling their house of which the mortgage, and the fixed interest rate, is tied to so there is a decrease in housing supply.  This decrease in housing supply offsets the decrease in demand for housing so house prices are unaffected.  The current supply constraints of housing continues to increase house prices.
